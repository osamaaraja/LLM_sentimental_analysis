neutral,the keyboard itself as keyboard works fine however there are few things that need improvement the backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off user that likes the back light to stay on not fan of the fading in out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols the enter key is too far to the right for comfortable typing selection meaning that the enter key should be where the key is normal keyboards have the enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the key where the enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key the keyboard isn that quiet hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make lot of noise ,177,4,Negative,"The feedback highlights several issues with the keyboard's design and functionality, such as inadequate backlighting, inconvenient key placement, and noise, which detract from the user experience.",2,Product quality: Build/Design Flaws,2

negative,although just yesterday ordered the jbl charge and so haven received it yet did some research into how the device charges on one end of the charging cable is the new and better type of usb connector usb and on the other the standard well familiar usb connector the charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of usb connector known as usb not the standard usb that we are well familiar with however the unit comes supplied with sided cable that will plug into standard usb port such as on most or all home and office computers and also some ac wall chargers the speaker does not come with this necessary usb accepting ac wall charger so if you do not have one already you have to buy one someplace otherwise simply plug it into usb port on computer the new type of usb connector usb is better because it is the same all around that is you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting it ll work no matter which way you plug it in much convenient design over the old think but am not sure that it might also work faster than the old and familiar usb connector however at least as of now there is still standard usb connector on the other end of the cable so perhaps the faster charging speeds assuming even correct on this might only be the case when these cables have the new type of usb usb connectors on both ends in any case as is it still better than the standard usb because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old standard usb connectors the fumbling can actually damage the insides of usb port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector like trying to force square peg into round hole after while the inners of the port will get bent out of shape however this is much more of problem with the standard mini usb connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices ,363,5,Neutral,"The feedback provides a detailed analysis of the USB charging design of the JBL Charge, highlighting both positive aspects and potential inconveniences without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.",3,Product quality: Build/Design Flaws,3
